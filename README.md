✨ Features
Two-player gameplay (Player X vs Player O)

Simple desktop GUI using Tkinter

Detects win, draw, and updates status dynamically

"Reset Game" and "New Game" buttons to restart anytime

Colorful and user-friendly interface inspired by a web version

🎮 Demo
To see a working version, download and run the Python file locally.
Live browser demo is not available as this is a desktop GUI application, not a web app.

🕹️ How to Play
Make sure you have Python installed.

Run the tic_tac_toe.py file in your terminal or any Python IDE.

Player O starts first, followed by Player X.

Click on an empty box to make your move.

The first player to align 3 of their symbols (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) wins.

If all boxes are filled with no winner, it's a draw!
